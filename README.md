This is a neural network with 3 hidden layers to recognize the hand-written digits 0-9. The data set contains 60000 training examples and 10000 testing examples of handwritten digits. Each training example is a 28-pixel x 28-pixel grayscale image of the digit. I used tensorflow to build and train this model. Normalization is done for a faster gradient descent. The accuracy was 96.36% .
